    <h2>Char Dham</h2>
        </div>
      </div>
<p>Uttarakhand, also known as Devbhoomi or the Land of Gods, is home to numerous temples and welcomes devotees all year round. Among the countless religious sites and circuits that devotees visit in Uttarakhand, one of the most prominent is the Char Dham Yatra. This Yatra or pilgrimage is a tour of four holy sites - Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath and Badrinath – nestled high up in the Himalayas. In Hindi, 'char' means four and 'dham' refers to religious destinations.</p>
<p>The high-altitude shrines remain shut for around six months every year, opening in summers (April or May) and closing with the onset of winter (October or November). It is believed that one should complete the Char Dham Yatra in a clockwise direction. Hence, the pilgrimage starts from Yamunotri, proceeds towards Gangotri, onto Kedarnath, and finally ends at Badrinath. The journey can be completed by road or by air (helicopter services are available). Some devotees even do a Do Dham Yatra or a pilgrimage to two shrines - Kedarnath and Badrinath.</p>
<p>The Yamunotri temple, lodged in a narrow gorge close to the source of River Yamuna (the second-most sacred Indian river after River Ganga) in Uttarkashi district, is dedicated to Goddess Yamuna. The district of Uttarkashi is also home to Gangotri dedicated to Goddess Ganga, the most sacred of all Indian rivers. Located in the Rudraprayag district lies Kedarnath, dedicated to Lord Shiva. Badrinath, home to the sacred Badrinarayan Temple, is dedicated to Lord Vishnu. The Char Dham Yatra is as divine as it is arduous but fulfills the soul!</p>

    <p>The Sun temple is situated in the small town of Konark situated in the Puri district of Odisha. This marvel of architecture is dedicated to Indian God of Sun, Surya. The temple has been built in the shape of his chariot which is drawn by seven horses.

      Pleased with his devotion, Surya healed him. Samba made the Sun temple in return to express his gratitude. The mesmerizing beauty of the place was best summed up by Rabindranath Tagore: ‘Here the language of stone surpasses the language of man.’</p>

After stopping at present day Banganga, Charan Paduka and Adkwari, the Goddess finally reached the holy shrine. When Bhairo Nath showed no sign of backing down, Vaishnavi was compelled to kill him.
        
        She beheaded him at the mouth of the cave and his head fell at a distant hill top. After realizing his mistake, Bhairo Nath begged for her forgiveness. Taking pity on him, the Goddess blessed him with a boon that anyone who takes up the pilgrimage to the shrine will also have to visit Bhairo Nath Temple, only then will the journey be completed.
