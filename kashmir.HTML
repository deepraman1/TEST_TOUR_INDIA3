                The beautiful sanctuaries of Jammu and Kashmir reward the nature seeker with views of diverse topography as well as the rarest species of wildlife. The state has several national parks and sanctuaries, aimed at protecting some of these endangered species. 
                <br>How To Get To Jammu & Kashmir
                <br>By flight - Visitors can fly into Jammu, Srinagar and Leh from most of the top cities in India on all leading airlines.
                
                <br>By rail - Udhampur is the last railway station on the northern railway line. Visitors can take the train up to this stop and then hire taxis or take a bus to go onwards. However, it is better to get down at Jammu as onward transport is more readily available from there.
                <br>By road - Travelers can drive into the state via Jammu and go up to Srinagar, or they can enter from Manali in Himachal Pradesh and drive up to Leh. There are several state-owned and private buses also that ply these routes.</I></B></P>
